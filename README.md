# Practice
<hr>
개인적으로 관심 갖고 배우고 싶은 것들을 위주로 연습하고 올려두었습니다. <br>
Codes, in this repository, are about what I've practiced individually with interest by following uploaders' codes on internet blogs.

I have no charge on the codes and have no enough knowledge to give any advice to others.
Some codes might not work, cause I didn't uploaded some files which contain my personal account password. 
If you have issue on them, I can help you where and what you must put in your account in your code. (like kakao API or MongoDB)
